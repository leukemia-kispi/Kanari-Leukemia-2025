# scRNAseq_analysis
Analysis of 3D and in vivo single cell RNA sequencing data

This repository contains all the pre-processing, inegration, downstream analysis and figure preparation for the manuscript: "A three-dimensional ex vivo model recapitulates in vivo features and unravels increased drug resistance in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia" from Kanari et al., 2025

# Dataset composition
The 3D data include leukemic, endothelial and mesenchymal stromal cells cultured in the Ectica plates. 

The in vivo data include leukemic cells from NSG mice at full PDX engraftment.

# Analysis 
The procesing and integration and downstream analysis of the leukemic PDX data can be found in the leukemic_cells_paper.R

The processing and downstream analysis of the mesenchymal stromal and endothelial cells can be found in the supporing_cells_paper.R

The graphs for the figures were created with the code found in [figures_paper.R]([url](https://github.com/mkanari/scRNAseq_analysis/blob/b5ee7778aeaca6fc446d70967c4ce65cea1f90a6/figures_paper.R))

The graphs for the supplementary figures were created with the code found in suppl_figures_paper.R
